# NESP-TWQ-5.2_Reef-exposures-R-analysis
This analysis looks at determining the relative strength of major reef disturbances (cyclones, bleaching and Crown-of-thorns starfish), normalising the strength to mortality from the event strength. This analysis is to configure an interactive diagram allowing multiple pressures to be turned on or off.
